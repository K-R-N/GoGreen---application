# Codecoverage folder

This folder contains a 2 weekly screenshots of our scrumboard on GitLab. The first screenshot will be made directly after the meeting and the second one on the last day of the week. 

Format of a scrumboard screenshot: `<date>_scrumboard.png`

## Notes for grading

* having a 'backlog' list and a 'done' list in our scrumboard --> +0.3 points
* having a 'to do' list  --> +0.1 point
* actually using it, not just as paperwork --> +0.1 point
