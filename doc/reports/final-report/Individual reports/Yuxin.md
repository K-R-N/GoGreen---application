* ### Reflection

   In general, this project was a very pleasant experience, I can’t imagine a better team I could meet, sometimes I was 
   totally impressed by my team member’s fantastic work, which pushed me to work harder and keep up. Everyone is so 
   helpful and very easy to communicate to, making the whole process went smoothly.
    
* ### Personal development

 > Introduction
    
   I would like to say I learned a lot from this project, It is my first time to work with others as a team to make a 
   programming project, I was mainly in charge of server side, which is a brand-new area for me, I searched a lot of 
   information on how the server side code should be structured and definitely grasped lots of new knowledge. Even
   though some of my work could not be done by me completely, I still learned a lot from looking into my team member’s 
   code.
   
 > Strong points
 
   As for my stronger points, Firstly, I will say I know better for myself how a complete java project should look like,
   how the different parts as GUI, client, server and database should combine together to make the whole program work, 
   which I think could be one of the most valuable lessons I learned from this project. Besides, my collaboration ability
   has also improved, I learned how to solve the conflicts between me and my team members and delivered the best result 
   together. 
   
 > Weak points
 
   As for my weak points, I will say from this project, I find that I still have difficulty solving a problem I 
   encounter by myself,  the reason why I couldn’t do that is I kind of can’t connect the different parts 
   of knowledge I learned before, like OOP and web. When I got stuck on some point, I got a little bit impatient and not
   confident about my ability. Secondly, I think my strategy to search information online still need to be 
   improved, at the beginning of the project, I spent quite a lot time on looking for the right information I need, but 
   it is getting better as the project moves on, I could find information resource quickly now.
