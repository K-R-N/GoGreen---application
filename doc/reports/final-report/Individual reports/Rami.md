# Individual Feedback

####   **Rami Al-Obaidi**

* #### Reflection
I worked on the backend side of the project specializing in the database department. I was responsible in creating 
and maintaining the databases that we used for our application (PostgreSQL) and for testing (SQLite). I worked on
 making the server be able to send and receive data from the database and optimize the methods/queries work in efficient ways.



* #### Personal development
> Introduction
Me and my team were able to communicate efficiently. We always stayed in touch when were away and had open discussions 
to solve any conflicts. Our planning early in the week enabled us to meet deadlines on time.

 > Weaker points

 My weak points were mainly to do with my weakness in networking as I wasnâ€™t able to help with working on
client-server communication. I feel this is a part where I need to improve on later as it is very critical
in application development. I also felt that I lacked in contributing in other departments of the project,
but I compensated this by perfecting the database department.
 
  
 > Stronger points
  
My strong points was mainly related to my good background in databases and my passion for data related topics.
 I was able to contribute to my team with helping in ensuring that we have a stable and efficient database 
 and guide them on testing database related methods in the project.
