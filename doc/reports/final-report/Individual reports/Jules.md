# Individual report Jules
## Reflection
This was the first real project of the CSE bachelor. I think it's great to get group work for a course, but not too much ;).  
On the negative side I think working in a group isn't really suited for the university, as that's mostly targeted at self development and that you don't get that much concrete knowledge from it.  
On the positive side though, these are the things I went to college for. I always worked alone and would never learn how to properly work together without projects like these. I learned so much from it, mainly that you can really efficiently divide subtasks to people that are better suited for them and that you, if you respect eachothers work, really can get done a lot in a short amount of time.  
In the introduction text that we all had to upload the first week I stated that I like to take leadership in projects. This also reflected in this project, as I really liked to handle the task division and keeping the project on track in general. I learned better what I do like to take leadership in and where I less like it.
Overall, I learned a lot from the project and really enjoyed the whole workflow around it.

## Personal development
### Introduction
I worked mainly on the GUI, the visual aspect of the project. Developing the visual aspects of an application really isn't my favorite part though. The reason that I took a lot of responsibility in this part is mainly because I did have the most experience on it, because previously I developed a full fledged application on iOS.  
Because my coding strength is mainly backend, I worked a lot on developing a great code base to easily make buttons, popups, scrolling etc. for the other people on the frontend to use that. I did really learn how to better structure frontend code from that.

### Weaker points
My weakest point in the project was definitely taking too much responsibility for the team. I've remodeled the core Models of the project just before I was going away for the weekend because I thought that it had to be done. In hindsight this was just really stupid of myself. When you work alone you can do these kind of things, but for groupwork you either have to plan ahead better or thoroughly discuss changes like these.
Other than weak points groupwise, I also took too much responsibiltiy for myself. I've spent way more time per week on coding than anticipated, just because I thought I could make some things even better. I find it hard to deliver half work, and I was also afraid of the project not being finished on time if I didn't do what I did. I found it hard to improve on this point, as I also really liked to work on the project. The main problem with this was me getting behind schedule of other courses, so it's really a personal thing. I'll keep trying to better get my priorities straight ;).

### Stronger points 
My strongest point during the project was me taking the lead. I've helped a lot in the beginning to get all the important structural things in place, like writing guides on how to create the weekly reports. I also kept track on the rubric to see which points we could get and which points we still needed to get. I also worked on general things to improve the workflow, like implementing Continuous Integration on GitLab and always positively approaching people on Slack or during the meetings. I tried to learn a lot on Scrum and agile development and immediately tried to apply it to the weekly meeting to see what worked and what didn't.  
Due to this search for improvement I also got better at dividing tasks and recognizing the strong and weak points of people.
Codewise I think I helped a lot on the visual aspect and could help a lot of team members when they got stuck on their task.
