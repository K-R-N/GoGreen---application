# Individual Feedback

* ### Reflection

    The project was a good learning experience. Everything was structured, there was good communication between team members 
and everyone did his part of the workload. Most people of our group even went as far as getting no sleep to get things done. 
And that is also one of the things I like about this group, that everyone does his part seriously. 
 
* ### Personal development
> Introduction
    
   I only worked on the GUI, so I did not do any coding on the server/database/client side of things. 
But despite me doing only GUI side of coding, I think I did a reasonably good job together with Dimitar and Jules who also 
worked on it. This is because everything looks like how we as a team had discussed it. Even though I did not know a lot of 
doing GUI coding before the project, I'm happy I did that part. This is because of the satisfying feeling I got after seeing 
something I partly designed myself looking like a real life application. 
   
 > Weak points
 
   There were some unexpected problems during the project such as a lot of tests failing where I as someone who works on the GUI 
   could not help much with because I had the thought that I would make things worse if I tried to help since I did not know how 
   the testing exactly was done. But despite this I tried to help as much as I could for example for merge request look at 
   the code and see if it works as intended. I also looked if it made sense for as much as I could comprehend it. 
   
   > Strong points
   
   Even though I’m not much of a talker as said in my personal development plan, I tried to join in on the conversations, 
   even though it wasn’t much talking from my side. I also tried to learn from the other for example learning the usage of views, 
   how server side is sort of done and such. Even though I did not have much experience with programming, I know I could always 
   depend on the others in case I was stuck on something. This also applies for the other way around, in case the others had 
   questions on things I understood, I tried to explain it in the best way I could.
