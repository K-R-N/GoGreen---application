# Individual Feedback

* #### Reflection
The project was an amazing and unique experience.
The joy of working on one thing with a group of people to reach a common goal was great,
and I think that there was no better group of people to work with than the one I had the pleasure of working with.
From day one we made the whole project structured in such a way that it gave me a sort of vibe that
we might be actually doing this for a living, which was fun.
Our plan made it so there were no major setbacks and that made it less stressful.
There were no conflicts throughout the whole project.
The support that we provided for each other made the whole project a very enjoyable learning experience.
Having situations when we all of us stayed up all night to fix errors was exhausting, but it made
for a very fun experience, I noticed that by working together we became an unstoppable machine of productivity,
which gave me more motivation to code no matter the consequences, the consequences being the lack of sleep.


* #### Personal development
> Introduction

For the application I started off working on the server side, 
because I wanted to implement all the functionality that the 
frontend would take advantage of to show the user the capabilities of my code.
I worked with different people, because some were switching their working positions, whilst i stayed on the server part of the project
 with the responsibility that everything on the server would be functional and up to date.
I had a lot of help from other people when things became messy on the server side of things
and I relied a lot on the database part, which made me 
realize how insignificant the whole product is if any of the parts were missing.

 > Weaker points

I would say that the biggest weakness for me throughout this project 
was my lack of curiosity. I had specific ideas for a basic application
and I searched for just a simple solution to solve the problems that were needed to be solved,
not even looking if there was an even more efficient way of dealing with it.
Without other peoples interference and ideas this project would have been half or maybe even less good
than it is right now. I did want to write complex lines of code, but that would have ended up being inefficient 
 and could have affected the team negatively therefore I don't really feel bad about not doing it. 
 
 
 
 
  > Stronger points
  
  One of my strongest points throughout the whole project was the control of the server
  and the awareness that if I were to not do my part then there would be a lot of issues
  that would follow in other parts of the project. I would say that the other strongest point would be
  the wish to have the whole project structured, I just felt like without having
  all of the tasks structured and approached one by one everything would have collapsed,
  that's why we all agreed on doing daily stand-ups,  to keep each other updated of what we did the day
   before and if any of us were stuck on something. 
  I needed the support of people and I'm sure at times they needed my support, 
  which is why having everything clear and structured plan 
  made asking for help a guilt free activity
  All the research on server methods and security helped my way of looking at this whole project.
