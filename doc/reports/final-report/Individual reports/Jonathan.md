* ### Reflection

    This was a very good and fun project, I learned alot during this quarter, including how to work better with a team, 
and how to make an application. I am happy to have a good group were everyone did there best. 
 
* ### Personal development
> Introduction
    
For the application I started with working on the server part. Making the basic methods and just learning how it would work. 
At first the server was very simple but after we better got to know how it worked, it got better. So I worked together with a couple other people on the server of the application.
I figured out sessions work in spring and how to make them work in our client, so how to sent and recieve a cookie in the client.
And because of this I also worked on the methods to get data from and to the client. 
When more of the essential server methods were done, I focussed more on the client and helped others to work on the server.

 > Weak points
 
 Sometime during this project when something had to be done, I would work alone to get it done without asking the help of team mates, 
 which are were very capable to help me. This would make it that I had to spend more time that I probalby had to, 
 to get it done.
 I improved on this quite allot, when I have something that I don't have/want the time for,
 I asked someone if they can help me, by either telling me how something works or working on some part of it. 
 When I started on this project I didn't have any programming experience outside of what I learned in OOP, 
 so almost everything was new to me. I didn't know how to do what needed to be done in this project. 
 I worked hard to get to understand how things work, like spring or other code team members wrote. 
 And now I know how spring works and how all parts of the project work. 
   
   > Strong points
   
   Like I said in my personal development plan, I was/am very interested to learn everything needed in making a working app. 
   I worked hard to get my things done on time, especially when someone is dependent on my work. 
   when problems came up I would spend alot of effort to make it work. There were times when this would mean working
   after midnight and one time all night.
   Because I wanted to learn how everything works I know how everything in the server and the client-server connection works, 
   and alot of how the connection between the server-database and the gui works.

We had alot of problems that would come up during the project. Like very big merge requests that would be almost 
impossible to fix for one example. But every week week during the meeting we would come up with solution to the problems.
