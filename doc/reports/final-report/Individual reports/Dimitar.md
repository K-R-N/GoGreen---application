* ### Reflection

    To start with, for me this entire project was an amazing and very unique experience. I had a lot of fun during the last
two months and I'm really grateful that I had the opportunity to work with such motivated and inspired people.
Everybody turned out to be a very nice person and I'm happy that this led to an awesome and positive atmosphere during
every single one of the meetings. The whole course for me felt like something I would do for fun, rather than something
that is mandatory and I just have to do.
 
* ### Personal development
> Introduction
    
   So, in the beginning I was a little nervous and lost, because I've never done such a thing and didn't know what exactly
 I should do and how the entire process went. But as time passed, with every single week I began to get used to the 
 environment and things slowly began to click. During our second meeting everybody had to choose on which part they
 wanted to work on the project and I chose to be in charge of the GUI along side with Kevin and Jules. I had never
 programmed in JavaFX before, but I wanted to learn it, because I was tired of seeing results of my work only in the 
 ugly terminal. This decision turned out to be great, because I got what i wanted and managed to design the whole
 visual application. 
 > Weak points
 
   During the learning process, I encountered a lot of issues, regarding not only JavaFX, but also Git. Luckily all of
   my team members were really helpful. Every time I encountered a blocking issue and got stuck, they would immediately
   try to figure out a way to solve my problem and always help me with it. Also, at the beginning, I had mentioned that 
   i struggle to motivate myself sometimes and actually do my task. However this was not an issue during this OOP project,
   first of all, because I really enjoyed the process in total and secondly, because all of the people from the group
   were very serious and dedicated to their work and that also pushed me to do my part as well. My biggest weak point,
   however, is that sometimes parts of my work remained not fully finished and people had to compensate for me.
   
   > Strong points
   
   As i said before, I worked on the GUI for the application; that's where my main contribution is. I created the layout
   for most of the pages and designed them. Apart from that I connected some of them to the actual data and actually
   made them functionable. During the meetings I often came up with various of ideas for the project itself: improving
   it, adding a new feature, changing the design style, etc. 
   In summary i managed to reach my goals for this project: I learned a lot of new things, gained some experience as in
   working as a team, found out how a real life application actually works and managed to work on what I like. Also, I met
   with some awesome people and saw their point of view for the project. I always listened to them and tried to speak
   last during the meetings, so that I hear everybody's opinion and consider different perspectives.
