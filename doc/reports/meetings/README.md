# Meetings folder

We will switch up the chairman and the secretary each week. Each role has his own responsibility.

**Chair**  
* No later than **saturday evening** before your meeting, create the file `<date>_agenda.md` in this folder, where `<date>` is the date of that meeting.  
This markdown file should contain the chair (you), the upcoming secretary and the points that needs to be discussed for that week.  
    > All team members can contribute to this list if they feel the need!
* Reflect back on the week with the team. Ask for every member what they did and how they did it. What went well? What didn't go so well? All kinds of that stuff...
* Discuss the points of the agenda.

**Secretary**
* After the meeting, create the file `<date>_notes.md` in this folder, where `<date>` is the date of that meeting.  
This markdown file should contain the chair, secretary (you) and the notes you've made during that meeting.
* During the meeting, write down the core points of the meeting. These really don't need to be that extensive.
* Also note what went well and what didn't went well for each member that week (about one sentence per person).

## Notes for grading
* **each** week contains an agenda --> +0.2 points
* **each** week contains meeting notes --> +0.1 point
* **each** week there is a new chair --> +0.1 point
