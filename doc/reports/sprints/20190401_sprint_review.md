# Sprint review week 3.7

## Main positivity encountered
#### Positivity 1: Teamwork was at it's peak. People worked insanely hard and were super dedicated.

#### Positivity 2: Deadlines were met and everything was finished on time.

#### Positivity 3: GUI Design drastically improved from previous weeks. 

## Main problems encountered
#### Problem 1: Planning was underestimated and half of the team members had to work all-nighters.
To prevent this problem, we are going to be more aware of our tasks for next sprint.
#### Problem 2: There many checkstyle errors and warnings 
To mitigate this, we will pay more attention to our code from the beginning.

*   Discuss in slack, what you are going to work on the upcoming day
> Everybody took part in the discussion and implemented this adjustment
*   We are going to put more priority on the task that others are dependent on first
> People finished the task which depended on others first, because there were more concrete in the beginning
