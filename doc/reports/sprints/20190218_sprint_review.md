# Spint review week 3.1
This weekend we all had to get used to working with git and IntelliJ, so no real individual tasks yet.

## Main problems encountered
### Problem 1: Meeting was quite exhausting
To mitigate this, we will take breaks during discussion next time.

### Problem 2: Meeting room was not really suited for discussion
We discussed in a computer room, which wasn't ideal. To mitigate this, we will try to book a better discussion room for the next meeting.
