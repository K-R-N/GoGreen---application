# Spint review week 3.6

## Main positivity encountered
#### Positivity 1: The new Stand-Up channel was very helpful and it improved the communication

#### Positivity 2: Everybody were very disciplined and dedicated to the project. They all worked really hard and till very late at night

#### Positivity 3: GUI Design improved even more and looks a lot mature and clean. 

## Main problems encountered
#### Problem 1: The re-modelling was done too late and there was big misscommunication about it
To prevent this, Client side team will be more concrete about what
 they need from the server side (methods, functions, etc.). 
 Also we are going to make announcements in the Stan-Up channel with the work we are going to do for the upcoming day.

#### Problem 2: Lack of progress
To mitigate this, we are going to put more priority on the task that others are dependent on first.

#### Problem 3: Work load was underestimated and way too big
For next time, everyone agreed on being more cautious in the Slack channels.

## Adjustments from previous sprints  
*   Create a development branch
> Not a lot of people used it, but people who did found it really helpful 
*   First merge master into own branch before creating a merge request
>  Everyone implemented this change and it lowered the amount of merge conflicts
*   Create a Stand-Up channel in Slack
> Everybody participated and put pressure on people to work hard and complete their work on time
## Adjustments for next sprint
* Discuss the more the major changes for the project
* Discuss in slack, what you are going to work on the upcoming day
* We are going to put more priority on the task that others are dependent on first.
* We are going to be more concrete about what we want from others.
