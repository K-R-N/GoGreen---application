# Sprint review week 3.8

## Main positivity encountered
#### Positivity 1: Due to our planning we didn't had to do a lot this week anymore

## Main problems encountered
#### Problem 1: There were still a lot of merge requests open because people forgot to directly approach one person to review them
To mitigate this, we'll try to be more direct with the approaching of the assignee this week.

#### Problem 2: Too much branches again
To prevent this problem from happening again, we'll create one branch per feature and try to merge it immediately when it's done.

## Individual progress and blocking issues
* **Jules van der Toorn**  
    * didn't to anything this week, was done with his task for now
    
* **Rami Al-Obaidi**  
    * implented removing achievement when removing activity
    * added the 'other' category
    * created limits for solar panels and insulation
    * implemented public/private accounts on server
    * no blocking issues

* **Kevin Nanhekhan**  
    * converted popups to new format
    * finalized the friends page to include outgoing requests
    * had blocking issue with getting mac address, but fixed this with help from Jonathan
    
* **Yuxin Jiang**  
    * worked on getting outgoing friend requests, but wasn't needed
    * created Mockito tests on the client
    * wrote draft report, but wasn't really ahead that he had to do it
    * had blocking issue during testing because he accidentally deleted test user during the progress, this was fixed quite soon after recognizing this though

* **Jonathan van Oudheusden**  
    * had to fix automatically updating of total points on GUI
    * kept track of what needed to be done
    * reviewed a lot of merge requests
    * only blocking issue was the one Yuxin also had, they worked on this together

* **Aleks Bako** 
    * implemented privacy change
    * wrote some tests
    * had no blocking issues

* **Dimitar Petrov**  
    * worked on the final report draft
    * displayed total points on GUI sidebar
    * added some logos
    * worked on adding communication failures on GUI
    * blocking issue: some progress was done late which resulted in it not being in master

## Adjustments from previous sprints  
* Communicate more before a change is needed and should be made
> there were no major changes, so we can't reflect on this for now
* Adjust the commit ratio
> we worked hard on this and it really balanced out a lot! we'll wrap this up in this last sprint
* Be more aware of the checkstyle errors and warnings
> everyone got more aware of this and there were almost no checkstyle warnings in the merge requests

## Adjustments for next sprint
* be more direct to the merge request assignee to review it
* try to limit the amount of branches by making one branch per feature
