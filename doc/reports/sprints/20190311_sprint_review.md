# Spint review week 3.4

## Main positivity encountered
### Positivity 1: We started early in the week

### Positivity 2: We made more commits more frequently

### Positivity 3: We communicated more and better

## Main problems encountered
### Problem 1: We didn't review all merge requests, resulting in features not being the release
To counter this, we decided to make a new deadline on saturday night to have all the merge requests reviewed.
This gives time on sunday to wrap up the work for that sprint.  
We'll also try to be more concrete about the individual who's responsible for a merge request.
This responsible person can ask another team member to review the request, as long as he (original assignee) makes sure it's being done before saturday night.

### Problem 2: Individual issues were sometimes still too big
We're still learning about how much workload each issue is.
This week we had some issues with issues being too big.  
We'll try to tweak this better for this sprint.

### Problem 3: Meeting took to long, we couldn't handle all points of discussion
To mitigate this, we'll keep more track of the time during the meeting and try to plan it better.

## Adjustments from previous sprints
* write clearer titles of issues
> we wrote clearer titles which resulted in eliminating the miscommunication
* make smaller commits and more frequently
> ths was definitely a lot better this sprint, which was very useful for the team, as they could follow the progress better
* set deadline for creating model classes on tuesday night
> completed successfully and we'll keep enforcing this deadline
* set deadline for finishing task + tests on friday night
> pushed us to work earlier, better time management
* speak up if you think there's something wrong with your tasks
> because of the better task division, this issue didn't appear in the sprint

## Adjustments for next sprint
* enforce deadline on saturday night for reviewing/merging all open merge requests
* tweak the workload per issue better (don't create too large issues)
* keep better track of the time during meetings, so we don't run out of time
